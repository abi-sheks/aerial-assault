# aerial-assault
A 2D bullet-hell (minus the bullets) game written in vanilla Javascript. The game is an endless space shooter (think Djimmi the Great level from Cuphead, though not as hard) where the player can collect numerous powerups
and shoot down enemy rockets. Very simple premise but quite fast paced (because im a masochist).

## Setup
- Clone the repo and ```cd``` into it.
- No bundler or packages involved, just open up the HTML file and go to town.
